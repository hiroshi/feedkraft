I tried to use nokogiri instead of rexml but I failed.
A feed xml has item node without namespace. Nokogiri, version 1.3.1 I used, doesn't seem handle them.
The nodes must have the name "item" has no name in parsed nokogiri document.
=begin
    require 'open-uri'
    require "nokogiri"

    xml = Nokogiri::XML.parse(open("http://feeds.journal.mycom.co.jp/haishin/rss/pc?format=xml"))
    xml.xpath("//*").each {|n| p n.path}
results:
"/rdf:RDF/text()[1]"
"/rdf:RDF/*[1]"
"/rdf:RDF/text()[2]"
"/rdf:RDF/*[2]"
...

The names of nodes replaced with '*'.
I think there are workaround or somting. However,
at very first stage of development process, I should not be bothered with this kind of things... I gave up.
=end
